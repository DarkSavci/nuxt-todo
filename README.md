# Just another todo app

I built this Nuxt 3 app to get a better understanding of how Vue/Nuxt works, coming from a Svelte background. Overall, I've found the experience to be quite positive. However, I did encounter some issues with Tailwind CSS IntelliSense because @nuxt/ui module's tailwind config is somewhere else.
